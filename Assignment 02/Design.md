# Design Document for Asset Manager App

## 1. Introduction
The Asset Manager App is a web-based application designed to assist organizations in managing their IT assets effectively. This document provides an overview of the system architecture, database design, user interface design, and integration points.

## 2. System Architecture
The Asset Manager App follows a three-tier architecture consisting of the following layers:

### 2.1 Presentation Layer
The presentation layer is responsible for handling user interactions and displaying the user interface. It includes the following components:
- HTML/CSS for structuring and styling the web pages
- JavaScript for client-side interactivity
- React framework for building dynamic user interfaces

### 2.2 Application Layer
The application layer contains the core logic of the Asset Manager App. It handles business processes and communicates with the database. The components in this layer include:
- RESTful APIs for handling HTTP requests and responses
- Business logic modules for processing data and implementing business rules
- Authentication and authorization modules for user access control

### 2.3 Data Layer
The data layer manages the storage and retrieval of data used by the Asset Manager App. It consists of the following components:
- Relational Database Management System (RDBMS)
- Database schema design to store asset information, user data, and related entities
- Database access layer for interacting with the database and executing SQL queries

## 3. Database Design
The Asset Manager App utilizes a relational database to store and manage data. The database design includes the following entities:

### 3.1 Asset
- Asset ID (Primary Key)
- Asset Name
- Description
- Category
- Status
- Assigned User
- Purchase Date
- Warranty Expiry Date

### 3.2 User
- User ID (Primary Key)
- Name
- Email
- Role
- Password (encrypted)

### 3.3 Category
- Category ID (Primary Key)
- Category Name

### 3.4 Status
- Status ID (Primary Key)
- Status Name

### 3.5 Relationships
- Assets are associated with a Category (many-to-one relationship).
- Assets have a Status (many-to-one relationship).
- Assets can be assigned to a User (many-to-one relationship).

## 4. User Interface Design
The user interface of the Asset Manager App should be intuitive, user-friendly, and responsive. The design principles include:

### 4.1 Navigation
- A consistent and easy-to-use navigation menu should be available across all pages.
- Clear links and buttons should guide users through the application.

### 4.2 Asset Management
- The asset management interface should provide options to view, create, update, and delete assets.
- Filtering and sorting options should be available for efficient asset search.

### 4.3 User Management
- User management features should include user registration, login, and user role assignment.
- Only authorized users should have access to administrative functions.

### 4.4 Reporting
- The reporting interface should allow users to generate customized reports based on various criteria such as asset status, category, or assigned user.

## 5. Integration Points
The Asset Manager App may integrate with the following systems:

### 5.1 Active Directory/LDAP
- Integration with the organization's Active Directory or LDAP server for user authentication and synchronization.

### 5.2 Barcode/QR Code Scanners
- Integration with barcode or QR code scanning devices to facilitate asset identification and management.

### 5.3 Email Notifications
- Integration with an email system to send notifications for asset assignments, warranty expirations, or overdue returns.

## 6. Deployment Architecture
The Asset Manager App can be deployed in a cloud-based environment using the following architecture:

- Application Server: A scalable server infrastructure to host the application and handle HTTP requests.
- Database Server: A separate server to host the relational database and manage data storage and retrieval.
- Load Balancer: Distributes incoming traffic to multiple application servers for load balancing and high availability.
- CDN (Content Delivery Network): Caches static assets for improved performance and global availability.
